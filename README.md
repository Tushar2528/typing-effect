This is a simple react application which is meant to teach us two very commonly used but less practised functionalities of a UI design

1- Typing effect : We have often seen typing animation when we browse any website. It can be easily implemented if we understand the concept of useEffect hook and JavaScript API's setInterval and clearInterval.

2- Text expand/collapse functionality : Implementing a "Read More" / "Read Less" functionality in UI design involves showing a truncated version of text content initially, and then allowing users to expand or collapse the content to see more or less of it. This is often used when dealing with long blocks of text to improve readability and conserve space.

Here's a basic approach to implement this functionality:

Initial State: Display the truncated version of the text with a "Read More" button.

Expand Text: When the user clicks the "Read More" button, display the full text content and replace the "Read More" button with a "Read Less" button.

Collapse Text: When the user clicks the "Read Less" button, revert back to the truncated version of the text and replace the "Read Less" button with the "Read More" button.
